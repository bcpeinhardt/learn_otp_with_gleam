  // There's a problem with the code above. If the task times out,

  //
  // FOOTGUN ALERT!: `task.try_await` will only protect you from a timeout or a "crash" (the process exiting).
  // If the task panics (which is subtly different than an exit), the current process will panic too!
  //
  // If you're thinking "That's kinda shit, what if I want to handle panicked
  // processes gracefully as well?", well, OTP has amazing constructs for that
  // called supervisors. It'd rather you use those than roll your own
  // shitty version.
  //
  // If you REALLY want to handle panicking tasks yourself, there's a function
  // called [rescue](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_erlang/gleam/erlang.html#rescue)
  // which takes any function and converts a panic into a result.
  // It's really meant for handling exceptions thrown in ffi erlang/elixir 
  // code though, you shouldn't need it when operating from the relative safety 
  // of Gleam land

  // And an example using it with tasks, shame on you for ignoring my sage advice.

  // To be clear, we're talking about protecting you from weird hard to
  // uncover concurrency bugs and network issues. Gleam's static typing
  // and immutability will do a good job protecting you from the run of the 
  // mill index out of bounds/foo is undefined bullshit. 
  // Just have your task return a `Result`
