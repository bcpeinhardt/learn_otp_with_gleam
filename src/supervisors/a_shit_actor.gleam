//// This module implements a shit actor that crashes every now and then.
//// Having an actor that fails every now and then will help us test out our supervisors.
//// If you need a refresher on actors, go revisit the `actor.gleam` and `actor/pantry` code.
//// 
//// Alright, let's implement of game of Duck Duck Goose as an actor.
//// 
//// (If this game is unfamiliar to you, children sit in a circle while 
//// one of them walks around behind the rest tapping them and saying "duck"
//// or "goose". They say "duck" for awhile, and nothing happens, but when 
//// they choose the "goose" all hell breaks loose and they chase each other 
//// around the circle. Interestingly in the midwest of the United States the
//// game is often called "Duck, Duck, Grey Duck".)

/// Okay, well this is new.
/// We're going to hand this actor off to supervisor,
/// which will manage starting it for us.
/// 
/// That means we can't simply get the subject out from 
/// the return, since we dont call the start function
/// directly. Instead, we'll have to send the subject
/// to the parent process when the actor starts up.
/// 
/// The `actor.start_spec` function gives us more fine-grained
/// control over how the actor gets created. We get to
/// provide a startup function to produce the initial state,
/// instead of simply providing the initial state directly.
/// 
/// We'll take advantage of getting the chance to compute
/// things on the new process to send ourselves back a subject
/// for the actor.
/// 
/// This isn't a hack, it's the intended design. The subject
/// produced by the `actor.start_spec` function is for the
/// supervisor to use, not for us to use directly.
