//// Alright time to learn about Supervisors
//// 
//// OTP applications are structured as "supervision" trees.
//// There are two types of processes in a supervision tree:
//// 1. Workers (these are the leaf nodes of the tree, they do all work)
//// 2. Supervisors (parent nodes of the tree, they manage the lifecycle of their child nodes, 
////    starting, stopping, restarting, and brutally killing them if necessary)
//// Pretty straightforward, workers do work, supervisors supervise.
//// 
//// Ok, why is this good? 
//// The propaganda goes like this:
//// 
//// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//// 
//// There are two kinds of bugs in software: consistent bugs and transient bugs.
//// 
//// Consistent (aka reproducible) bugs are really common but easy to discover and fix.
//// Good testing (and in Gleam's case, a good type system) can help with this.
//// 
//// Transient bugs are more rare, but they are a pain to diagnose and fix, and so they
//// are often left in the codebase for a long time.
//// 
//// The best approach we have for fixing these bugs when we can't reproduce them is to 
//// turn the damn thing off and on again.
//// 
//// Turning your tv off and on again is lame, but doable.
//// Turning a running production system off and on again is a non starter.
//// 
//// This is where supervisors come in. They are designed to provide common sense strategies
//// for turning their child processes off and on again when they crash.
//// 
//// By designing our application as a tree of these supervisors and workers, we can turn
//// JUST THE BROKEN PART off and on again, while the rest of the system keeps on running.
//// 
//// A supervisor will "detect" what the broken part is by slowly restarting layers, starting 
//// at the smallest layer and incrementing its way up the tree, until everything works again.
//// 
//// This architecture plus the BEAM's ability to update code while it is still running
//// are why these technologies are so good at building fault-tolerant systems.
//// 
//// Systems with transient concurrency bugs still operate mostly correctly, and one
//// can debug and fix the broken part without taking the system down.
//// 
//// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
////
//// Evangelism complete. I don't need to give you the "everything's a tradeoff, 
//// there's no free lunch" speech, right?
//// 
//// Ok, I should put my money where my mouth is and show you some code.
//// To show how this works in practice, we need to write a program that crashes EVERY NOW AND THEN.
//// Such a program has been written in `supervisors/a_shit_actor.gleam`. Go read that and then
//// come back here.
//// 
//// Back? Great, read on.
